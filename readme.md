# THIS README FILE WILL HELP YOU TO KNOW QUICKLY HOW THE CODE WORKS #

About:

Project name - Dank memer replica (command line).  
Project author - SnappingComet28.


How it works:

There is a main.py file that initialises the dank memer into the terminal.  
After it is booted, it will check in ./user/user.json to check(using log.py) if the user have any login info.  
If there is any info, it will directly move to taking queries.  
If there isnt any info, it will take the login info(its only username for now cuz its on local machine) and logs him in.  
After it logs in, it will then start taking queries(commands to play).  
When "bye" is written, it terminates.
